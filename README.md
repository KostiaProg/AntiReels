## AntiReels/Tiktok/Shorts pet project by Kostiantyn Solovei

I trained yolo26 model on phone detection dataset so if it, using the webcam, detects a phone - 
the shield banging skeleton from the meme appears (using python-vlc library) which speed ups with consecutive plays

The program also asks user to show or not show live webcam, and if it does, it will put text on it if the user starts scrolling reels
